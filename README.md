# Zenodo OntoPortal Monitoring

## Setup

Create a file named `token.txt` with your Zenodo API token string.

## Using

The notebook contains to output functions:
- `display_record_list_md()`: create raw markdown content (in a check-list format) for all records.

In both outputs, records that are already listed in the OntoPortal Zenodo community are identified.
